Description: The `pacu` package is intended to provide a variety of 
    functions that are commonly used when processing data that 
    can be characterized as precision agriculture related. 
    For instance, there are functions to download and process 
    raw satellite images from Sentinel 2. These can be used to 
    investigate spatial patterns within a given area of interest. 
    The package also includes functions that download vegetation 
    index statistics for a given period of time, without the need to 
    download the raw images. These can be used to investigate the 
    temporal variability of a vegetation index across the field, or
    between fields, for example. There are also functions to download
    and visualize weather data in a historical context. These can be 
    used to explain temporal variability in crop yield or vegetation 
    index values from between years, or fields. Lastly, the package
    also contains functions to process yield monitor data. These 
    functions can build polygons around recorded data points, 
    evaluate the overlap between polygons, clean yield data, 
    and smooth yield maps.
